# Reindeer - Moose sugar in ruby

This is mostly an idea that doesn't yet any useful reality. The
idea being to have the features of [Moose](http://p3rl.org/Moose)
available in ruby.

# Installation

TODO - Need a gemspec

# Usage

See spec/ for now.

# Features

These features are supported to a greater or less extent:

* attributes
  * accessors
  * defaults
  * laziness
  * type constraints
  * delegators
  * default
* roles
* build_all

# TODO

* method modifiers
* metaclasses?
